        This method takes a list of `AbstractProblem`s and returns a `PlanGenerationResult`,

        :param heuristic: is a function that given a state returns its heuristic value or `None` if the state is a
                          dead-end, defaults to `None`.
        :param timeout: is the time in seconds the generalized planner has to solve all problems, defaults to `None`.
