        not violate a time constraint, it is said inconsistent otherwise.

        The DeltaSTN is a specific implementation of STN specifically engineered for planning purposes;
        it's main point is the capability of creating a lot of different DeltaSTN, that have a small
        difference one-another, without having to re-do all the calculations about the STN consistency.

        Also, being a persistent data-structure, it also optimizes the memory usage.
